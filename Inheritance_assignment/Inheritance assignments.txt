1)
class base
{
	public:
		base(char *ptr)
		{
		}
};
class sub:public base
{
};

Following statements should be possible

sub s;

sub *s1=new sub(40);

sub *s2=new sub('a',4.5);

2) 
class parent
{
	public:
		disp1()
		disp2()
		disp3()
		disp4()
};
class sub:private parent
{
	public:
		disp5()
};

make sure u can do the following

sub s(30);
s.disp5();
s.disp3();
s.disp1();

3) 
class course
{
	//here
};
class DacCourse:public course
{
	// here
};

you should be able to say following

course *c=new course;
c->fees(); // course version should be called
c=new DacCourse;
c->fees();  // DacCourse version should be called


4) 
Create a base class FourWheeler. Declare pure virtual function “void start()” in it. 			
Define following sub classes for this class. 
A) Qualis b) Sumo c) Volvo 					
Define “start” function in these classes.			In main function , create array of pointer to FourWheeler which will contain objects of these three sub classes. 
Now traverse the array and call all the child class methods.

5)
Define a class “MyNum” having a member variable “int num” and “void disp()”;	
	From main function, perform following				
	a) MyNum m1(20);						b) m1=100; //Do not use Constructor for this purpose			
	c) int k;						
	d) k=m1;							
	e) cout<<endl<<k<<endl;


6) create a base1 and base2 classes in the library.
constructors, member variables and functions you can have in the above classes of your choice.

now create an application where you have to create a child class of above classes.
in the main function create an instance of child class and try to access methods of base1 and base2.

7)
Create a base class “Subject”.Declare pure virtual function “void maxmarks()” in it.  Define following sub classes for this class. A) Maths b) History c) English.	Define “maxmarks” in these classes.

now write a global function "show" which will accept "subject class pointer" as an argument. this function should be able to call "maxmarks()" of any child class which is passed.
From main function try to call this function by passing various child classes.


8) same as above except it has to be done using reference of parent class.
